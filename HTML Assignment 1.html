    <p><b>HTML tags on text arrangement, style, color. Design a page which looks like the text given below.</b></p>
    <h2>Assignment 1: Basic HTML Display Features</h2>
    <p>Here is an example of a horizontal rule:</p>
    <hr>
    <p>To begin, we can change the</p>
    <h3>header size</h3>
    <p>and <span style="color: blue;">color of letters</span> seen on the screen. The <span style="font-size: 24px;">font size</span> can be changed as well, and actually gives more choices.</p>
    <p>We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some differing word types in a blocked quote.</p>
    <blockquote>Now is the <i>time</i> for all good <b>people</b> to <b>come</b> to the <i>aid</i> of their country.</blockquote>
    <p>That was also an example of a nested command.</p>
